# This helper script is made for wiping S50 7byte UID cards with Gen2 magic commands from restored state to blank one.
#
# Scenario:
# You want to clone 7byte Mifare 1k card using RfidResearchGroup Proxmark3 RDV4.0
#
# Step 1: Dumping original card and making a Mifare 7byte UID clone using S50 7byte UID
#
# Place original card to the reader.
# Dump data and recover keys
#
# hf mf autopwn
#
# You will get data, EML and key file. Backup this file, you will need them to wipe the card back to blank state.
# Place blank S50 card to the reader.
#
# Get first line from EML file (block0) and write it down using command
#
#                             Place it here
#                                    |
#                                    |
#                                    v
# hf mf wrbl 0 B FFFFFFFFFFFF 046E46AAA53480084400120111003113
#
# Now restore all the data using built-in restore command
#
# hf mf restore
#
# Step 2: Recovering S50 7byte UID card to the blank state
#
# Find current card data files from Step 1 in your backup or if you lost them create them again using 'hf mf autopwn' command.
# Place them in current working directory.
#
# Read hf-mf-CARD_UID-data.eml file and copy it content with CTRL-C.
# Place it to the eml variable in this script.
#
# Check execution command and check device and command name: 'proxmark3 -c "%s" /dev/tty.usbmodemiceman1'
#
# Run script and review key blocks returning to default FFFFFFFFFFFF state.
# Be patient! It is executing aprox 3 minutes.
# Success one result looks like:
#
# Block 0: Success: isOk:01
# Block 3: Success: isOk:01
# Block 7: Success: isOk:01
# Block 11: Success: isOk:01
# Block 15: Success: isOk:01
# Block 19: Success: isOk:01
# Block 23: Success: isOk:01
# Block 27: Success: isOk:01
# Block 31: Success: isOk:01
# Block 35: Success: isOk:01
# Block 39: Success: isOk:01
# Block 43: Success: isOk:01
# Block 47: Success: isOk:01
# Block 51: Success: isOk:01
# Block 55: Success: isOk:01
# Block 59: Success: isOk:01
# Block 63: Success: isOk:01
#
# Thats it! Your S50 7byte UID card is wiped back. Now you can return back to Step 1 of this manual.
