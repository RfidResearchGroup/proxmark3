Compilation notes
=================

Besides the global Proxmark3 requirements, this flasher compatible with very old firmwares requires the libusb 0.1 to work.
So you'll need to install the libusb 0.1 package first.

* OSX: libusb-compat
* Debian-alike: libusb-0.1-4 libusb-dev
* Arch: libusb
* Fedora: libusb-devel
