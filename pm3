Quick helper script for proxmark3 client when working with a Proxmark device connected via USB

Description:
    The usage is the same as for the proxmark3 client, with the following differences:
     * the correct port name will be automatically guessed;
     * the script will wait for a Proxmark to be connected (same as option -w of the client).
    Don't use this script if you want to work offline or with the BT addon.

Usage:
    $SCRIPT [-f] [-c <command>]|[-l <lua_script_file>]|[-s <cmd_script_file>] [-i]

See "$CLIENT -h" for more details on options.

Quick helper script for flashing a Proxmark device via USB

Description:
    The usage is similar to the old proxmark3-flasher binary, except that the correct port name will be automatically guessed.
    If this doesn't work, you'll have to use manually the proxmark3 client, see "$CLIENT -h".

Usage:
    $SCRIPT [-b] image.elf [image.elf...]

Options:
    -b         Enable flashing of bootloader area (DANGEROUS)

Example:
     $SCRIPT -b bootrom.elf fullimage.elf
