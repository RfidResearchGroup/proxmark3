// Implements a card only attack based on crypto text (encrypted nonces
// received during a nested authentication) only. Unlike other card only
// attacks this doesn't rely on implementation errors but only on the
// inherent weaknesses of the crypto1 cypher. Described in
//   Carlo Meijer, Roel Verdult, "Ciphertext-only Cryptanalysis on Hardened
//   Mifare Classic Cards" in Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC Conference on
//   Computer and Communications Security, 2015
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// brute forcing is based on @aczids bitsliced brute forcer
// https://github.com/aczid/crypto1_bs with some modifications. Mainly:
// - don't rollback. Start with 2nd byte of nonce instead
// - reuse results of filter subfunctions
// - reuse results of previous nonces if some first bits are identical
//

// Bit-sliced Crypto-1 brute-forcing implementation
// Builds on the data structures returned by CraptEV1 craptev1_get_space(nonces, threshold, uid)
