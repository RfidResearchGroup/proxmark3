- Iclass read, `hf iclass read` now also reads tag config and prints configuration. (holiman)
- *bootrom* needs to be flashed, due to new address boundaries between os and fpga, after a size optimization (piwi)

### Fixed
- Fixed EM4x50 read/demod of the tags broadcasted memory blocks. 'lf em4x em4x50read' (not page read) (marshmellow)

## [2.0.0] - 2015-03-25
### Changed
- LF sim operations now abort when new commands arrive over the USB - not required to push the device button anymore.

### Fixed
- Mifare simulation, `hf mf sim` (was broken a long time) (pwpiwi)
- Major improvements in LF area and data operations. (marshmellow, iceman1001)
- Issues regarding LF simulation (pwpiwi)

### Added
- iClass functionality: full simulation of iclass tags, so tags can be simulated with data (not only CSN). Not yet support for write/update, but readers don't seem to enforce update. (holiman).
- iClass decryption. Proxmark can now decrypt data on an iclass tag, but requires you to have the HID decryption key locally on your computer, as this is not bundled with the sourcecode.
