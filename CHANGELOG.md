## [2.0.0] - 2015-03-25
### Changed
 - LF sim operations now abort when new commands arrive over the USB - not required to push the device button anymore.

### Fixed
 - Mifare simulation, `hf mf sim` (was broken a long time) (@pwpiwi)
 - Major improvements in LF area and data operations. (@marshmellow42, @iceman1001)
 - Issues regarding LF simulation (@pwpiwi)
 - Issue interpreting NXP "get sys info" command return value for icode tags. (@mjacksn)

### Added
 - iClass functionality: full simulation of iclass tags, so tags can be simulated with data (not only CSN). Not yet support for write/update, but readers do not seem to enforce update. (@holiman).
 - iClass decryption. Proxmark can now decrypt data on an iclass tag, but requires you to have the HID decryption key locally on your computer, as this is not bundled with the sourcecode.
 - `hf 15 info` can detect NTAG 5 tags
 - `hf 15 info` include an EAS status check on more of the icode tags which support EAS (SLI, SLIX, SLIX-L, and SLIX-S)
