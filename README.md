## Support on other Proxmark3 platforms
In order to build this repo for other Proxmark3 platforms we urge you to read [Advanced compilation parameters](/doc/md/Use_of_Proxmark/4_Advanced-compilation-parameters.md)

## What has changed?

On the hardware side:

  * added flash memory 256kb.
  * added smart card module
  * added FPC connector

On the software side: quite a lot, see the [Changelog file](CHANGELOG.md).

## Development
This fork now compiles just fine on 
   - Windows/mingw environment with Qt5.6.1 & GCC 4.8
   - Ubuntu 1404, 1510, 1604, 1804, 1904
   - Mac OS X / Homebrew
   - ParrotOS, Gentoo, Pentoo

## Cheat sheet
Thanks to Alex Dibs, you can enjoy a [command cheat sheet](/doc/cheatsheet.md)

## Why didn't you base it on official Proxmark3 Master?

The separation from official Proxmark3 repo gives us a lot of freedom to create a firmware/client that suits the RDV40 features. We don't want to mess up the official Proxmark3 repo with RDV40 specific code.

## Proxmark3 GUI
The official PM3-GUI from Gaucho will not work.
The new universal GUI will work. [Proxmark3 Universal GUI](https://github.com/burma69/PM3UniversalGUI) Almost, change needed in order to show helptext when client isn't connected to a device.

## Issues

Please see the [Proxmark Forum](http://www.proxmark.org/forum/index.php) and see if your issue is listed in the first instance Google is your friend :) Questions will be answered via the forum by Iceman and the team. 

It's needed to have a good USB cable to connect Proxmark3 to USB. If you have stability problems (Proxmark3 resets, firmware hangs, especially firmware hangs just after start, etc.) - check your cable with a USB tester (or try to change it). It needs to have a resistance smaller or equal to 0.3 Ohm.
