# How to build?
## Proxmark3 RDV4
See the instruction links in the tables above to build, flash and run for your Proxmark3 RDV4 device.

## Generic Proxmark3 platforms
In order to build this repo for generic Proxmark3 platforms we urge you to read [Advanced compilation parameters](/doc/md/Use_of_Proxmark/4_Advanced-compilation-parameters.md)

We define generic Proxmark3 platforms as following devices.

**Supported**
  - RDV1, RDV2, RDV3 easy
  - Ryscorp green PCB version
  - Radiowar black PCB version
  - numerous Chinese adapted versions of the RDV3 easy (kkmoon, PiSwords etc)

**Not supported**
 - âš   Proxmark Evolution (EVO) 
   - **Note**: unknown pin assignments.
 - âš   Ryscorp Proxmark3 Pro 
   - **Note**: device has different fpga and unknown pin assignments.
 - âš   i-copy 
   - **Note**: reversed hw,  experimental support maintained in [icopyx-community pm3 repo](https://github.com/iCopy-X-Community/icopyx-community-pm3)

**Unknown support status**
 - âš   VX
   - **Note**: unknown device hw


**256kb flash memory size of generic Proxmark3 platforms**

> âš  **Note**: 
> You need to keep a eye on how large your ARM chip built-in flash memory is. 
> With 512kb you are fine but if its 256kb you need to compile this repo with even less functionality.
> When running the `./pm3-flash-all` you can see which size your device have if you have the bootloader from this repo installed. 
> Otherwise you will find the size reported in the start message when running the Proxmark3 client `./pm3`.
>
> [OBS! Read the 256kb flash memory advisory](/doc/md/Use_of_Proxmark/4_Advanced-compilation-parameters.md#256kb-versions)


## What has changed?

Proxmark3 RDV4 hardware modifications:
  * added flash memory 256kb
  * added smart card module
  * added FPC connector for peripherals such as Bluetooth+battery addon
  * improved antennas
    * swappable
    * LF Q factor switch
    * LF 125/134 frequency switch
  * tiny PCB form factor
  * ABS case

This repo vs official Proxmark3 repo:
see the [Changelog file](CHANGELOG.md) which we try to keep updated. In short this repo gives you a completely different user experience when it comes to Proxmark3.
  * richer CLI with use of colors / emojis
  * help text system implemented everywhere
  * hints system
  * user preference settings
  * extensive testing with continuous integration build systems on Linux, OSX and Windows, and regular usage of static analysis tools like 
    * [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/proxmark3-rrg-iceman-repo/)
    * Cppcheck
    * GCC and Clang aggressive enforcement of diagnostic flags
  * auto detection of serial ports and seamless integration with Bluetooth addon
  * reconnect to device from inside client
  * Supports tearoff attacks
  * the most comprehensive compiled known keys dictionaries
  * Slimed down usb communications with NG-frames
  * the most compiled public known key recovery software
  * the fastest implementations of said software
  * support multiple fileformats for dump files (BIN/EML/JSON) 
  * interoperability of said fileformats with libnfc, MFC tool app etc
  * Supports more RFID based protocols than ever
  * Easy install for package maintainers, distro maintainers
  * More documentation 


  
All of this and more is what makes this repo different from any other Proxmark3 firmware / client software. It is truely bleeding edge in that sense of available functionality and experience with it. With all extensive testing its also quite more stable than any other Proxmark3 repo.


## Development

> âš  **Note**: This is a bleeding edge repository. The maintainers actively is working out of this repository and will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build, test, and contribute to, so **DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis**.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Remember!** If you intend to contribute to the code, please read the [coding style notes](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
We usually merge your contributions fast since we do like the idea of getting a functionality in the Proxmark3 and weed out the bugs afterwards.

The [public roadmap](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/wiki/Public-Roadmap) is an excellent start to read if you are interesting in contributing.

## Precompiled binaries
We don't maintain any precompiled binaries in this repo. There is community effort over at the Proxmark3 forum where package maintainer [@gator96100](https://github.com/gator96100) has set up a AWS bucket with precompiled Proxspace (MinGW) binaries which are recompiled every night and with that also up-to-date. We link to these files here as to make it easier for users. If you are having troubles with these files, we suggest to read the [homepage of his proxmark builds](https://www.proxmarkbuilds.org/) or read the [sticky thread at forum](http://www.proxmark.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=24763#p24763)

## Proxmark3 GUI

The official PM3-GUI from Gaucho will not work. Not to mention is quite old and not maintained any longer.

- [Proxmark3 Universal GUI](https://github.com/burma69/PM3UniversalGUI) will work more or less.

- [Proxmark3 GUI cross-compiled](https://github.com/wh201906/Proxmark3GUI/) which is recently updated and claims to support latest source of this repo.
- [Proxmark3_GUI](https://github.com/Phreak87/Proxmark3_GUI) simple gui in vb.net
