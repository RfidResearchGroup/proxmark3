# Iceman Fork - Proxmark3

The Proxmark3 is the swiss-army tool of RFID, allowing for interactions with the vast majority of RFID tags on a global scale. Originally built by Jonathan Westhues, the device is now the goto tool for RFID Analysis for the enthusiast. Iceman repository is considered to be the pinnacle of features and functionality, enabling a huge range of extremely useful and convenient commands and LUA scripts to automate chip identification, penetration testing, and programming

# How to build?

## Proxmark3 RDV4

See the instruction links in the tables above to build, flash and run for your Proxmark3 RDV4 device.

## Generic Proxmark3 platforms

In order to build this repo for generic Proxmark3 platforms we urge you to read [Advanced compilation parameters](/doc/md/Use_of_Proxmark/4_Advanced-compilation-parameters.md)

We define generic Proxmark3 platforms as following devices.

**Supported**
  - RDV1, RDV2, RDV3 easy
  - Ryscorp green PCB version
  - Radiowar black PCB version
  - numerous Chinese adapted versions of the RDV3 easy (kkmoon, PiSwords etc)

**Not supported**
 - ⚠  Proxmark Evolution (EVO) 
   - **Note**: unknown pin assignments.
 - ⚠  Ryscorp Proxmark3 Pro 
   - **Note**: device has different fpga and unknown pin assignments.
   - **Note**: Company have disappeared, leaving their customers in the dark.
 - ⚠  iCopy-X
   - **Note**: experimental support, currently incompatible with iCopy-X GUI as Proxmark client commands are now using cliparser.
   - **Note**: see also [icopyx-community repos](https://github.com/iCopy-X-Community/) for upstream sources, reversed hw etc.
   - **Note**: Uses DRM to lock down tags, ignores the open source licences. Use on your own risk. 

**Unknown support status**
 - ⚠  VX
   - **Note**: unknown device hw
-  ⚠ Proxmark3 X 
   - **Note**: unknown device hw
-  ⚠ Proxmark3 Ultimate
   - **Note**: unknown device hw
-  ⚠ Proxmark3 SE
   - **Note**: unknown device hw

When it comes to these new unknown models we are depending on the community to report in if this repo works and what they did to make it work.


**256KB flash memory size of generic Proxmark3 platforms**

> ⚠ **Note**: 
> You need to keep a eye on how large your ARM chip built-in flash memory is. 
> With 512KB you are fine but if its 256KB you need to compile this repo with even less functionality.
> When running the `./pm3-flash-all` you can see which size your device have if you have the bootloader from this repo installed. 
> Otherwise you will find the size reported in the start message when running the Proxmark3 client `./pm3`.
>
> [OBS! Read the 256KB flash memory advisory](/doc/md/Use_of_Proxmark/4_Advanced-compilation-parameters.md#256KB-versions)

# Development

> ⚠ **Note**: This is a bleeding edge repository. The maintainers actively is working out of this repository and will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build, test, and contribute to, so **DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis**.

> 👉 **Remember!** If you intend to contribute to the code, please read the [coding style notes](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
We usually merge your contributions fast since we do like the idea of getting a functionality in the Proxmark3 and weed out the bugs afterwards.

The [public roadmap](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/wiki/Public-Roadmap) is an excellent start to read if you are interesting in contributing.
