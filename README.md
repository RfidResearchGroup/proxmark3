## Precompiled binaries
We don't maintain any precompiled binaries in this repo. There is community effort over at the Proxmark3 forum where @gator96100 has set up a google drive with many mingw binaries which is up-to-date. We link to these files here as to make it easier for users.
If you are having troubles with these files, contact the package maintainer @gator96100 and read the [sticky thread at forum](http://www.proxmark.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=24763#p24763) where known issues has been documented.

## Roadmap
The [public roadmap](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/wiki/Public-Roadmap) is an excellent start to read if you are interesting in contributing.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Remember!** If you intend to contribute to the code, please read the [coding style notes](HACKING.md) first.
We usually merge your contributions fast since we do like the idea of getting a functionality in the Proxmark3 and weed out the bugs afterwards.


## Issues & Troubleshooting
Please search the [issues](https://github.com/rfidresearchgroup/proxmark3/issues) page here and see if your issue is listed in the first instance.
Read the [Troubleshooting](/doc/md/Installation_Instructions/Troubleshooting.md) guide to weed out most known problems.

Next place to visit is the [Proxmark Forum](http://www.proxmark.org/forum/index.php). Learn to search it well and finally Google / duckduckgo is your friend :)    You will find many blogposts, youtube videos, tweets, reddit

## Cheat sheet

Thanks to Alex Dibs, you can enjoy a [command cheat sheet](/doc/cheatsheet.md)

## Maintainers ( package, distro )

To all distro, package maintainers, we tried to make your life easier. `make install` is now available and if you want to know more.

## Why didn't you base it on official Proxmark3 Master?

The separation from official Proxmark3 repo gives us a lot of freedom to create a firmware/client that suits the RDV40 features. We don't want to mess up the official Proxmark3 repo with RDV40 specific code.

## Proxmark3 GUI

The official PM3-GUI from Gaucho will not work.
The new [Proxmark3 Universal GUI](https://github.com/burma69/PM3UniversalGUI) will work more or less. Change is needed in order to show helptext when client isn't connected to a device.  We don't know how active the maintainers.
