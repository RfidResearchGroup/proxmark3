## What has changed?

On the hardware side:

  * added flash memory 256kb.
  * added smart card module
  * added FPC connector

On the software side: quite a lot, see the [Changelog file](CHANGELOG.md).

## Development

> âš  **Note**: This is a bleeding edge repository. The maintainers actively is working out of this repository and will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build, test, and contribute to, so **DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis**.

This repo compiles nicely on 
   - Proxspace v3.x
   - Windows/mingw environment with Qt5.6.1 & GCC 4.8
   - Ubuntu 1604, 1804, 1904
   - Mac OS X / Homebrew
   - ParrotOS, Gentoo, Pentoo, Kali, Nethunter, Archlinux, Fedora
   - WSL, WSL2  (Windows subsystem linux) on Windows 10
   - Docker container

The [public roadmap](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/wiki/Public-Roadmap) is an excellent start to read if you are interesting in contributing.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Remember!** If you intend to contribute to the code, please read the [coding style notes](HACKING.md) first.
We usually merge your contributions fast since we do like the idea of getting a functionality in the Proxmark3 and weed out the bugs afterwards.

## Cheat sheet

Thanks to Alex Dibs, you can enjoy a [command cheat sheet](/doc/cheatsheet.md)

## Maintainers ( package, distro )

To all distro, package maintainers, we tried to make your life easier. `make install` is now available and if you want to know more.

## Why didn't you base it on official Proxmark3 Master?

The separation from official Proxmark3 repo gives us a lot of freedom to create a firmware/client that suits the RDV40 features. We don't want to mess up the official Proxmark3 repo with RDV40 specific code.

## Proxmark3 GUI

The official PM3-GUI from Gaucho will not work.
The new universal GUI will work. [Proxmark3 Universal GUI](https://github.com/burma69/PM3UniversalGUI) Almost, change needed in order to show helptext when client isn't connected to a device.

## Issues

Please see the [Proxmark Forum](http://www.proxmark.org/forum/index.php) and see if your issue is listed in the first instance Google is your friend :) Questions will be answered via the forum by Iceman and the team. 

Read the [Troubleshooting](/doc/md/Installation_Instructions/Troubleshooting.md) guide to weed out most known problems.
