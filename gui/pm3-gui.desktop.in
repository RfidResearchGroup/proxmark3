# If you place the `proxmark3.svg` into ~/.local/share/icons or the system icons
# directory, desktop environments will pick it up automatically. The `install-desktop.sh`
# script copies the .desktop file but does not manage icons; package installers
# or distro packagers should place the icon accordingly.
