# Security Policy

This is an open source project driven by volunteering devs contributing their time for free.

This is a bleeding edge repository. 
The maintainers actively is working out of this repository and will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build, test, and contribute to, so DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

if you find a vulnerability feel free to make a pull request with your fix and we will deal with it.


ðŸ‘‰ Remember! 
If you intend to contribute to the code, please read the coding style notes first. We usually merge your contributions fast since we do like the idea of getting a functionality in the Proxmark3 and weed out the bugs afterwards.
