                Following code is a trivial brute forcer once you read a valid tag
                the idea is you get a valid tag, then just try and brute force to
                another priv level. The problem is that it has no idea if the code
                worked or not, so its a crap shoot. One option is to time how long
                it takes to get a valid ID then start from scratch every time.
