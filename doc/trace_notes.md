## Trace command
^[Top](#top)

The `trace` command lists the data exchange by the proxmark3 and a tag or a reader in human readable form.

With `trace list` a table is shown which gives timing information, the src of the data bytes, the transmitted/received bytes itself, a check if the CRC was correct and some decoding of the command.

### Timing
^[Top](#top)

The Start and the End column lists timestamps when the transmission of the shown data started (time of first bit) and when it ended (end of last modulation).

The unit for this time information depends on the protocol in use:

* ISO14443A and Thinfilm: all times are in carrier periods (1/13.56MHz)
* For Legic timing information depends also on direction:
 * Reader Mode: Timings are in ticks (1us == 1.5ticks)
 * Tag Mode: Timings are in sub carrier periods (1/212 kHz == 4.7us)
* Hitag1 / Hitag2 / HitagS: Elementary Time Unit (ETU) is 8Âµs
* iCLASS, ISO15693, ISO18092 and FeliCa have no accurate timing information at the moment
* For others timing is not available

By specifying the option ```f``` (e.g. ```trace list -t 14a -f```) the frame delay times are shown. (So you don't have to do the math by your own).

### Sources
^[Top](#top)

If the data is marked as a response the source is shown as Tag. Otherwise it is marked as Reader (Rdr).

### Data
^[Top](#top)

This column shows the raw bytes transmitted over the air. With option ```c``` CRC bytes are marked in square brackets.

### CRC
^[Top](#top)

Marks if the transmitted CRC matches with the calculated CRC.

### Annotation
^[Top](#top)

Annotations provide a rough decoding of the transmitted data. For ISO14443A a more detailed decoding is available with Wireshark (s. next chapter)

## Tracelog format
^[Top](#top)

The binary format for the dynamic tracelog is as following.

```
 /*
   Traceformat:
   32 bits timestamp (little endian)
   16 bits duration (little endian)
   15 bits data length (little endian) (0x7FFF)
   1 bit isResponse (0=reader to tag, 1=tag to reader)
   data length Bytes data
   x Bytes parity,  where x == ceil(data length/8)
*/

typedef struct {
    uint32_t timestamp;
    uint16_t duration;
    uint16_t data_len : 15;
    bool isResponse : 1;
    uint8_t frame[];
    // data_len         bytes of data
    // ceil(data_len/8) bytes of parity
} PACKED tracelog_hdr_t;

#define TRACELOG_HDR_LEN        sizeof(tracelog_hdr_t)
#define TRACELOG_PARITY_LEN(x)  (((x)->data_len - 1) / 8 + 1)
```

## Trace and Wireshark
^[Top](#top)

To get a more detailed explanation of the transmitted data for ISO14443A traces the output can be converted to a pcapng file to read it with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

To do so

* use `trace list -t 14a -x`
* copy the output (starting with the timestamp) into a textfile
* run `text2pcap -t "%S." -l 264 -n <input-text-file> <output-pcapng-file>`
* now open your pcapng file in Wireshark or read it with the CLI version `tshark`

An example frame

with `trace list -t 14a`:

```
19072 |      29536 | Rdr |93  70  88  04  cf  ff  bc  7f  bb  |  ok | SELECT_UID
```

the same data with `tshark -r foo.pcapng -V -x`:
