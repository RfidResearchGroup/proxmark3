# Trace command notes

The `trace` command lists the data exchange by the proxmark3 and a tag or a reader in human readable form.

With `trace list` a table is shown which gives timing information, the src of the data bytes, the transmitted/received bytes itself, a check if the CRC was correct and some decoding of the command.

## Timing

The Start and the End coloumn lists timestamps when the transmission of the shown data started (time of first bit) and when it ended (end of last modulation).

The unit for this time information depends on the protocol in use:

* ISO14443A and Thinfilm: all times are in carrier periods (1/13.56MHz)
* For Legic timing information depends also on direction:
 * Reader Mode: Timings are in ticks (1us == 1.5ticks)
 * Tag Mode: Timings are in sub carrier periods (1/212 kHz == 4.7us)
* Hitag1 / Hitag2 / HitagS: Elementary Time Unit (ETU) is 8Âµs
* iClass, ISO15693, ISO18092 and FeliCa have no accurate timing information at the moment
* For others timing is not available

By specifing the option ```f``` (e.g. ```trace list 14a f```) the frame delay times are shown. (So you don't have to do the math by your own).

## Sources

If the data is marked as a response the source is shown as Tag. Otherwise it is marked as Reader (Rdr).

## Data

This coloumn show the raw bytes trasmitted over the air. With option ```c``` CRC bytes are marked in square brackets.

## CRC

Marks if the transmitted CRC matches with the calculated CRC.

## Annotation

Annotations provide a rough decoding of the transmitted data. For ISO14443A a more detailed decoding is available with Wireshark (s. next chapter)

# Trace and Wireshark

To get a more detailed explanation of the transmitted data for ISO14443A traces the output can be converted to a pcapng file to read it with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

To do so

* use `trace list 14a x`
* copy the output (starting with the timestamp) into a textfile
* run `text2pcap -t "%S." -l 264 -n <input-text-file> <output-pcapng-file>`
* now open your pcapng file in Wireshark or read it with the CLI version `tshark`

An example frame

with `trace list 14a`:

```
19072 |      29536 | Rdr |93  70  88  04  cf  ff  bc  7f  bb  |  ok | SELECT_UID
```

the same data with `tshark -r foo.pcapng -V -x`:

```
