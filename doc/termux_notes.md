# Proxmark 3 on Android

## Requirements
- Android phone
- Kernel with one of:
    - USB_ACM driver
    - module loading enabled
    - published sources
- Root
- [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)

## Notes
From official Proxmark3 wiki:
 > In any case, you would need a USB-C to A or USB-OTG cable to connect Proxmark3 to your Android device. Some Android devices may not supply enough power (USB-OTG = 100mA), and need a USB Y-cable and external battery, otherwise they will get strange failures.

## Setup
### Setting up Termux
Install [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) and start it
### Install Proxmark3 package
Run the following commands:
```
pkg install proxmark3 tsu
```
### Optional: Building Proxmark3 client from source
```
pkg install make clang clang++ readline libc++ git tsu
git clone https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3.git
cd proxmark
make clean && make client
```

### USB_ACM
You need the `USB_ACM` driver enabled and working to communicate with the Proxmark3. To see if it's working, run `tsudo ls /dev/tty*` and it should list `/dev/ttyACM0` (or similar). If you see this, congratulations, skip this step!

#### Enable the driver
If  your kernel has module loading enabled, you should be able to build the module separately and load it on your system without any changes. Otherwise, grab your kernel sources and edit your build config to include `CONFIG_USB_ACM=y`. On the tested kernel, this was under: `android_kernel_oneplus_msm8998/arch/arm64/configs/omni_oneplus5_defconfig`

#### Building the kernel
If using a custom kernel, refer to the build instructions provided by its maintainer. Otherwise, follow the standard Linux kernel build procedure

#### Flashing the kernel
You can flash the kernel however it suits you. On the tested device, this was achieved using [TWRP](https://twrp.me/), the most popular custom recovery

### Testing
Open Termux and start the Proxmark3 client:
```
tsudo proxmark3/client/proxmark3 /dev/ttyACM0
```
Everything should work just like if it was your PC!

### Troubleshooting
- `dmesg | grep usb` - useful debug info
- `/proc/config.gz` - contains your kernel's build configuration. Look for `CONFIG_USB_ACM`, which should be enabled
