## T55xx

^[Top](#top)

The temic T55xx/Atmel ATA5577 is the most commonly used chip for cloning LF RFIDs.

A useful document can be found [here](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/blob/master/doc/T5577_Guide.md).

### Characteristics

* 28/24 bytes of user memory (without/with password)
* Universal output settings (data rate, modulation, etc)
* Password protection (4 bytes), usually "19920427"
* Lock bits per page
* Analog frontend setup
* Other names:
  * 5577
  * 5200 (CN)
    * Cut down version of T55xx chip (no analog frontend setup, no test mode support).
  * H2 (RU)
    * Seems to be renamed 5200 chip.
  * RW125T5 (RU)
* Old variant "T5555" is hard to come across

### Detect

```
[usb] pm3 --> lf search
...
[+] Chipset detection: T55xx
```

This will **not** work if you have a downlink mode other than fixed bit length!

### Commands

*See ATMEL ATA5577C datasheet for sending commands to chip*

* *Do not mix* "password read" and "regular write" commands! You risk potentially writing incorrect data.
* When replying, the chip will use the modulation and data rate specified in block 0.

## EM4x05

^[Top](#top)

The EM4305 and EM4205 (and 4469/4569) chips are the 2nd most common used chips for cloning LF RFIDs.
It is also used by HID Global (but with a custom chip) for HIDProx credentials.

### Characteristics

* 36 bytes of user memory
* Output settings are limited (ASK only, FSK added on HID variant)
* Password protection (4 bytes), usually "84AC15E2"
* Lock page used
* Other names:
  * H3 (RU)
  * RW125EM (RU)

### Detect

```
[usb] pm3 --> lf search
...
[+] Chipset detection: EM4x05 / EM4x69
```

### Commands

*See EM microelectronic EM4305 datasheet for sending commands to chip*

## ID82xx series

^[Top](#top)

These are custom Chinese chips mainly used to clone EM IDs. Often times, these are redesigned clones of Hitag chips.

### ID8265

^[Top](#top)

This is the cheapest and most common ID82xx chip available. It is usually sold as T55xx on AliExpress, with excuses to use cloners.

#### Characteristics

* Chip is likely a cut down version of Hitag μ (micro) clone
* UID `00 00 00 00 00 00`
* Password protection (4b), usually "00000000"(default) or "9AC4999C"(FURUI)
* CON0
  * bit 0-1 -> data rate ’00’... 2kbit/s ’01’... 4kbit/s ’10’... 8kbit/s ’11’... 2kbit/s
  * bit 2 when set, fixed to MC 2kbit/s
  * bit 3-6 reversed? all blocks always read without password and write with password
  * bit 7 -> enable TTF
* Currently unimplemented in proxmark3 client
* Other names:
  * ID8210 (CN)
  * H-125 (CN)
  * H5 (RU)
    * The sales of "H5" have been ceased because "the chip was leaked".

#### Detect

```
[usb] pm3 --> lf cmdread -d 50 -z 116 -o 166 -e W3000 -c W00011 -s 3000
[usb] pm3 --> data plot
```

Check the green line of the plot. It must be a straight line at the end with no big waves.

# ISO14443A

## Identifying broken ISO14443A magic

^[Top](#top)

When a magic card configuration is really messed up and the card is not labeled, it may be hard to find out which type of card it is.

Here are some tips if the card doesn't react or gives error on a simple `hf 14a reader`:

Let's force a 4b UID anticollision and see what happens:

```
hf 14a config --atqa force --bcc ignore --cl2 skip --rats skip
hf 14a reader
```

It it responds, we know it's a TypeA card. But maybe it's a 7b UID, so let's force a 7b UID anticollision:

```
hf 14a config --atqa force --bcc ignore --cl2 force --cl3 skip --rats skip
hf 14a reader
```

At this stage, you know if it's a TypeA 4b or 7b card and you can check further on this page how to reconfigure different types of cards.

To restore anticollision config of the Proxmark3:

```
hf 14a config --std
```

## Mifare Classic Direct Write OTP

^[Top](#top)

Chip manufactured by iKey LLC as a bypass for Gen1 filters.
Support Direct Write as CUID, but block0 can be written only once.

The chip had an issue in the protocol implementation.

The reader could interrupt radiofield for 2-3 microseconds (standard pause in the bit period of ISO14443-2).
After the response to first `26 (7)` command, but before the following `93 70` command. In that case original M1 card will stop the flow, but OTP will continue it.

That issue led to the development of the filters against that card and discontinuation of the production.

As a successor, [OTP 2.0](#mifare-classic-otp-20) was created.

### Characteristics

^[Top](#top)

* Initial UID is AA55C396
* Android compatible

* issue special APDUs

```
cla  ins p1  p2  len
 90  F0  CC  CC  10 <block0>  - write block 0
 90  FB  CC  CC  07 <uid>     - change uid (independently of block0 data)
 90  FD  11  11  00           - lock permanently
```

It seems the length byte gets ignored anyway.

Note: it seems some cards only accept the "change UID" command.

It accepts direct read of block0 (and only block0) without prior auth.

Writing to block 0 has some side-effects:

* It changes also the UID. Changing the UID *does not* change block 0.
* ATQA and SAK bytes are automatically replaced by fixed values.
* On 4-byte UID cards, BCC byte is automatically corrected.

### Characteristics

^[Top](#top)

* UID: 4b and 7b versions
* ATQA/SAK: fixed
* BCC: auto
* ATS: none

## MIFARE Classic USCUID

^[Top](#top)

TLDR: These magic cards have a 16 byte long configuration page, which usually starts with 0x85.
All of the known tags are using this, except for Ultralight tags, are listed here.

You cannot turn a Classic tag into an Ultralight and vice-versa!

### Characteristics

^[Top](#top)

* UID: 4/7 bytes
* ATQA: always read from block 0
* SAK: read from backdoor or configuration
* BCC: read from memory, beware!
* ATS: no/unknown

                              ^^ >> SAK***

To enable an option, set it to 5A.
* 5A - unfused F0. C3 - F0: CL2 UID; A5 - F1: CL2 UID with anticollision shortcut; 87 - F2: CL1 Random UID; 69 - F3: CL1 non-UID. Anything else is going to be ignored, and set as 4 bytes.
** Do not change the real ACL! Backdoor commands only acknowledge FF0780. To recover, disable this byte and issue regular write to sector trailer.
*** If perso byte is enabled, this SAK is ignored, and hidden SAK is used instead.
```

* Gen1a mode:                            Allow using custom wakeup commands, like real gen1a chip, to run backdoor commands, as well as some extras.
* Magic wakeup command:                  Use different wakeup commands for entering Gen1a mode. A) 00 - 40(7), 43; B) 85 - 20(7), 23.
* Block use of Key B if readable by ACL: Per the MF1ICS50 datasheet, if Key B is readable by the ACL, using it shall give a Cmd Error 04. This option controls whether it happens or not.
* CUID mode:                             Allow direct write to block 0, instead of giving Cmd Error 04.
* MFC EV1 CL2 Perso config:              When configured, the tag behaves like a real Mifare Classic EV1 7B UID tag, and reads UID from backdoor blocks. Otherwise, the tag acts like a 4 byte tag.
* Shadow mode:                           Writes to memory persisting in tag RAM. As soon as no power is left, the contents are restored to saved data.
* Magic Auth Command:                    Acknowledge command `8000` after selection, and call for Crypto1 auth with key `000000000000`.
* Static encrypted nonce mode:           Use static encrypted nonces for authentication, making key recovery impossible.
* Signature sector:                      Acknowledge auth commands to sector 17, which is stored in backdoor sector 1.
* SAK:                                   If perso byte is not set, after UID select, send this value.

*Read and write config commands are flipped

Well-known variations are described below.

## FUID

^[Top](#top)

Known as "write only once", which is only partially true. Please note that some newer FUIDs have had ton configration blocks locked down and are truly a write-once tag.

Allows direct write to block 0 only when UID is default `AA55C396`. If your tag responds to a gen4 magic wakeup, the UID could always be rewritten multiple times with backdoors commands.

Backdoor commands are available even after the personalization and makes that tag detectable.

That's a key difference from [OTP](#mifare-classic-direct-write-otp)/[OTP 2.0](#mifare-classic-otp-20) tags.

### Characteristics

^[Top](#top)

* Configuration block value: `7AFF85000000000000FF000000000008`
* Initial UID: `AA55C396`
* Allows direct write to the block 0 (before the personalisation), so is Android compatible
* Responds to magic wakeup `20(7)`, `23` commands

## UFUID

^[Top](#top)

The tag is positioned as "sealable UID", so that means you could use the same commands, as you could use for UID chip in a default state. But after the sealing (changing the configuration) tag will not answer to the backdoor commands and will behave as a normal Mifare Classic tag.

*But at the same time there is some unidentified behavior, which doesn't fully corresponds the protocol and original Mifare Classic tags. So the tag could be filtered out with a protocol-based filters (i.e. Iron Logic OTP2 filter).*

### Characteristics

^[Top](#top)

* Configuration block value: `7AFF000000000000BAFA000000000008`
* No direct write to block 0
* Responds to magic wakeup `40(7)`, `43` commands before the sealing
* Acknowledge only the first (except wakeup command) and last config byte(s), so doesn't have the hidden block

### Commands

^[Top](#top)

All commands are available before sealing. After the sealing acts as a Mifare Classic 1K tag.

* Magic wakeup: `40(7)`, `43`
  * Backdoor read main block: `30xx+crc`
  * Backdoor write main block: `A0xx+crc`, `[16 bytes data]+crc`
  * Read configuration: `E000+crc`
  * Write configuration: `E100+crc`
* Example of the sealing, performed by Chinese copiers in raw commands:

```
hf 14a raw -a -k -b 7 40
hf 14a raw    -k      43
hf 14a raw    -k -c   e100
hf 14a raw       -c   85000000000000000000000000000008

## MIFARE Classic, other versions

^[Top](#top)

**TODO**

* ZXUID, EUID, ICUID, KUID?

## MIFARE Classic Super

^[Top](#top)

It behaves like regular Mifare Classic but records reader auth attempts.

### MIFARE Classic Super Gen1

^[Top](#top)

Old type of cards, hard to obtain. They are DirectWrite, UID can be changed via 0 block or backdoor commands.

* UID: 4b version
* ATQA/SAK: fixed
* BCC: auto
* ATS: fixed, 0978009102DABC1910F005

ATQA/SAK matches 1k card, but works as 4k card.

Backdoor commands provided over APDU. Format:

```
00 A6 A0 00 05 FF FF FF FF 00
^^ ^^                         Backdoor command header
      ^^                      Backdoor command (A0 - set UID/B0 - get trace/C0 - reset card)
         ^^                   Type of answer (used in key recovery to select trace number)
            ^^                Length of user provided data
               ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ User data
```

👉 You can't change UID with backdoor command if incorrect data is written to the 0 sector trailer!

### MIFARE Classic Super Gen1B

DirectWrite card, ATS unknown. Probably same as Gen1, except backdoor commands.
Implementation: https://github.com/netscylla/super-card/blob/master/libnfc-1.7.1/utils/nfc-super.c

### MIFARE Classic Super Gen2

^[Top](#top)

New generation of cards, based on limited Gen4 chip. Emulates Gen1 backdoor protocol, but can store up to 7 different traces.

Card always answers `ff  ff  ff  ff` as `at`, so reading/writing it via Mifare protocol is impossible.

UID is changeable via UMC backdoor write to 0 block.

* UID: 4b and 7b versions
* ATQA/SAK: fixed
* BCC: auto
* ATS: changeable, default as Gen1

Gen4 commands available:

```
CF <passwd> 34 <1b length><0-16b ATS>            // Configure ATS
CF <passwd> CC                                   // Version information, returns 00 00 00 02 AA
CF <passwd> CD <1b block number><16b block data> // Backdoor write 16b block
CF <passwd> CE <1b block number>                 // Backdoor read 16b block
CF <passwd> FE <4b new_password>                 // Change password
```

Computing BCC1 on UID 04112233445566: `analyse lrc -d 33445566` = `44`

Int is internal, typically 0x48

Anticol shortcut (CL1/3000) is supported for UL, ULC, NTAG except NTAG I2C

Some cards have a password: `B6AA558D`. Usually "copykey" chips.

**WARNING!** When using UL-5 to clone, write UID pages in inverse (from 2 to 0) and do NOT make mistakes! This tag does not allow reversing one-way actions (OTP page, lock bits).

#### Identify

## MIFARE Ultralight USCUID-UL

^[Top](#top)

TLDR: These magic cards, like the MFC USCUIDs have a 16 byte long configuration page, comprised of 4 blocks of 4 bytes each. This usually starts with 0x85. All of the known tags use the same format config page.

The cards will respond to a RATS with the config page in the factory configuration.

As with the MFC USCUIDs, one cannot turn a Classic tag into an Ultralight and vice-versa!

### Characteristics

^[Top](#top)

* UID: 7 bytes
* ATQA: always read from hidden block `F6`
* SAK: always read from hidden block `F6`
* BCC: read from blocks 0-1 per Ultralight specification
* ATS: These respond to an ATS request with the config page in factory mode.

### Identify

^[Top](#top)

In factory config state:

```
hf 14a info
...
[=] -------------------------- ATS --------------------------
[!] ATS may be corrupted. Length of ATS (18 bytes incl. 2 Bytes CRC) doesn't match TL
[+] ATS: 85 00 85 A0 00 00 0A A5 00 04 04 02 01 00 0F 03 [ 07 00 ]
```

If config has been modified to not display config block as ATS response:

```
hf 14a raw -akb 7 40; hf 14a raw -k 43

OR (depending on the magic wakeup method set)

hf 14a raw -akb 7 20; hf 14a raw -k 23

THEN

hf 14a raw -c e100
[+] 85 00 85 A0 00 00 0A A5 00 04 04 02 01 00 0F 03 [ 07 00 ]
```

Possible tag wakeup mechanisms are:

* Gen1 Magic Wakeup
* Alt Magic Wakeup

                  ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ >> Version info

* This isn't a customizable value - it's a preset. So far:
C3 = UL11
3C = UL21
00 = UL-C
A5 = NTAG 213
5A = NTAG 215
AA = NTAG 216
55 = Unknown IC w/ 238 pgs.
```

* Gen1a mode:                            Allow using custom wakeup commands, like real gen1a chip, to run backdoor commands, as well as some extras.
* Magic wakeup command:                  Use different wakeup commands for entering Gen1a mode. A) 00 - 40(7), 43; B) 85 - 20(7), 23.
* Config available using regular mode:   If this option is turned on via A0, the tag will reply to RATS with the config block and the config block can be modified without doing a magic wakeup.

To write config:

You must send config info in E2 packets of 4 bytes each (format: `E2[offset*4, 1b][data, 4b]`), eg for a UL-11 tag:

```
hf 14a raw -sck E200850000A0; hf 14a raw -ck E20100000AC3; hf 14a raw -ck E20200040301; hf 14a raw -c E20301000B03
```

2. Hidden blocks

        ^^^^       >> Unknown, usually always 00

F8 - FF: xxxxxxxx  >> signature
```

To read / write hidden blocks:

A config block beginning with `7AFF` must be set to enable a `40:43` / `20:23` magic wakeup. From limited testing, the `20:23` magic wakeup is not guaranteed to work, however the `40:43` wakeup works 100% of the time.

You must send config info in A2 packets of 4 bytes each (format: `A2[offset*4, 1b][data, 4b]`), eg for a UL-11 tag:

```
hf 14a raw -akb 7 40; hf 14a raw -k 43; hf 14a raw -ck A2F2000000BD; hf 14a raw -ck A2F3000000BD; hf 14a raw -ck A2F4000000BD; hf 14a raw -ck A2F644000400; hf 14a raw -c A2F888AF0000

### Identify

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

👉 **TODO** If the password is not default, Tag doesn't get identified correctly by latest Proxmark3 client (it might get mislabeled as MFC Gen2/CUID, Gen3/APDU or NTAG21x Modifiable, depending on configured UID/ATQA/SAK/ATS)

👉 **TODO** Using C6 command can change config due to a bug in some cards. CC should be used instead.

```
hf 14a info
[+] Magic capabilities : Gen 4 GTU
```

The card will be identified only if the password is the default one. One can identify manually such card if the password is still the default one, with the command to get the current configuration:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000C6
```

If the card is an Ultimate Magic Card, it returns 30 or 32 bytes.

### Magic commands

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

There are two ways to program this card.

   1.  Use the raw commands designated by the `hf 14a` examples.

   ***OR***

   2.  Use the hf_mf_ultimatecard.lua script commands designated but the `script run hf_mf_ultimatecard` examples. This script is nof fully compartible with new version UMC.


script run hf_mf_ultimatecard.lua -h

### Characteristics

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

* UID: 4b, 7b and 10b versions
* ATQA/SAK: changeable
* BCC: computed
* ATS: changeable, can be disabled
* Card Type: changeable
* Shadow mode: GTU
* Backdoor password mode

### Proxmark3 commands

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
# view contents of tag memory:
hf mf gview
# Read a specific block via backdoor command:
hf mf ggetblk
# Write a specific block via backdoor command:
hf mf gsetblk
# Load dump to tag:
hf mf gload
# Save dump from tag:
hf mf gsave
```

👉 **TODO** `hf mf gview` is currently missing Ultralight memory maps

Equivalent:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CE00
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CE01
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CE02
...
```

👉 **TODO** In Mifare Ultralight / NTAG mode, the special writes (`hf mfu restore` option `-s`, `-e`, `-r`) do not apply. Use `script run hf_mf_ultimatecard` for UID and signature, and `hf mfu wrbl` for PWD and PACK.

### Change ATQA / SAK

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>35<2b ATQA><1b SAK>
```

* ⚠ ATQA bytes are swapped in the command
* ⚠ ATQA bytes that result in `iso14443a card select failed` (I.E.  ATQA=0040 in raw form) can be corrected with `hf 14a config --atqa force`
* ⚠ when SAK bit 6 is set (e.g. SAK=20 or 28), ATS must be turned on, otherwise the card may not be recognized by some readers!
* ⚠ never set SAK bit 3 (e.g. SAK=04), it indicates an extra cascade level is required (see `hf 14a config --cl2 skip` or `hf 14a config --cl3 skip` to recover a misconfigured card)

Example: ATQA 0044 SAK 28, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF0000000035440028
```

OR (Note the script will correct the ATQA correctly)

```
script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -q 004428
```

### Change ATS

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>34<1b length><0-16b ATS>
```

* `<length>`: ATS length byte, set to `00` to disable ATS
* ⚠ when SAK bit 6 is set (e.g. SAK=20 or 28), ATS must be turned on, otherwise the card may not be recognized by some readers!
* ATS CRC will be added automatically, don't configure it
* Max ATS length: 16 bytes (+CRC)

Example: ATS to 0606757781028002F0, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF000000003406067577810280
```

Or

```
script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -z 06067577810280`
```

### Set UID length (4, 7, 10)

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>68<1b param>
```

* `<param>`
  * `00`: 4 bytes
  * `01`: 7 bytes
  * `02`: 10 bytes

Example: set UID length to 7 bytes, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF000000006801
```

### Set 14443A UID

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

UID is configured according to block0 with a backdoor write.  (Script commands are below the UID length examples)

Example: preparing first two blocks: (Note the UMC has to be in MFC mode and the correct UID byte length set)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CD00000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CD01101112131415161718191A1B1C1D1E1F
hf 14a reader
```

MFC mode 4b UID

=> UID `00010203`

`script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -t 4 -u 00010203`

MFC mode 7b UID

=> UID `00010203040506`

`script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -t 5 -u 00010203040506`

MFC mode, 10b UID

=> UID `00010203040506070809`

`script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -t 6 -u 00010203040506070809`

Ultralight mode, 4b UID

=> UID `00010203`

Ultralight mode, 7b UID

=> UID `00010210111213`

👉 the UID is composed of first two blocks as in regular Ultralights

* Examples
  * UL-EV1 48b = `script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -t 12 -u 00010203040506`
  * UL EV1 128b = `script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -t 13 -u 00010203040506`
  * NTAG 215 = `script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -t 18 -u 00010203040506`

Ultralight mode, 10b UID
=> UID `00010203040506070809`
👉 the UID is composed only from block0

### Set 14443B UID and ATQB

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

* UID and ATQB are configured according to block0 with a (14a) backdoor write.
* UID size is always 4 bytes.
* 14B will show up only on new cards. (Need more tests on new card. Example not work)

Example:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CD00000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F
hf 14b reader
```

=> UID 00010203
=> ATQB 0405060708090A

### (De)Activate Ultralight mode

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>69<1b param>
```

* `<param>`
  * `00`: MIFARE Classic mode
  * `01`: MIFARE Ultralight/NTAG mode

Example: activate Ultralight protocol, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF000000006901
```

Or

```
script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -n 01
```

In this mode, if SAK=`00` and ATQA=`0044`, it acts as an Ultralight card

⚠ only the first four bytes of each block will be mapped in the Ultralight memory map (so the Ultralight block numbers follow backdoor R/W block numbers).

### Select Ultralight mode

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>6A<1b param>
```

* `<param>`
  * `00`: UL EV1
  * `01`: NTAG
  * `02`: UL-C
  * `03`: UL

⚠ it supposes Ultralight mode was activated (cf command `69`)

Example: set Ultralight mode to Ultralight-C, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF000000006A02
```

Or

```
script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -m 02
```

Now the card supports the 3DES UL-C authentication.

### Set Ultralight and M1 maximum read/write sectors

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>6B<1b blocks>
```

Hexadecimal, maximum sector data, default 0xFF, range 0x00-0xFF

Example: set maximum 63 blocks read/write for Mifare Classic 1K

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF000000006B3F
```

### Set shadow mode (GTU)

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

This description of shadow modes wroted by seller at marketpalces:

>This mode is divided into four states: off (pre-write), on (on restore), don’t care, and high-speed read and write. If you use it, please enter the pre-write mode first. At this time, write the full card data. After writing, set it to on. At this time, after writing the data, the first time you read the data just written, the next time you read It is the pre-written data. All modes support this operation. It should be noted that using any block to read and write in this mode may give wrong results.

And these conclusions were made after a number of tests with UMC (new version, configured as MFC for example):

| Mode | Buffer | Standart command (rdbl, wrbl e.t.c)     | Backdoor command (gsetblk, ggetblk, gload e.t.c.) |
|------|--------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 2,3  |  buf23 | read/write from/to buf23                | read/write from/to buf23                          |
|  0   |  buf0  | read from buf0, write to buf0 and buf23 | read/write from/to buf23                          |
|  4   |   -    | read from buf0, write to buf23          | read/write from/to buf23                          |

Mode 1: For new card this mode looks like a bug. Reading/writing first two block use *buf23*. Reading other blocks use invalid region of memory and all returned data looks like pseudo-random. All acl looks like invalid. All data is readable by the keys and acl wich was written in *buf0*. Any writing operations in this mode use copy of *buf0* and only it. It`s not affected any other buffers. So if you change keys or/and acl you will must use new keys to read data.

Example (not work with new UMC):
`script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -w 1 -g 00 -t 18 -u 04112233445566 -s 112233445566778899001122334455667788990011223344556677 -p FFFFFFFF -a 8080 -o 11111111 -g 01`

* -w 1 = wipe the card in Ultralight Mode
* -g 00 = turn on pre-write mode
* -t 18 = change the type of card to NTAG 215
* -u = set the uid
* -s = set the signature
* -p = set the NTAG password
* -a = set the PACK
* -o = set the OTP
* -g 01 = turn on restore mode

At this point the card is set to a unwritten NTAG 215. Now any data written to the card will only last for 1 read.  Write a popular game toy to it, read it, now it is back to the unwritten NTAG 215.

👉 Remember to disable GTU mode to get the card back to a normal state.

`script run hf_mf_ultimatecard -g 03`

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>32<1b param>
```

* `<param>`
  * `00`: pre-write, shadow data can be written
  * `01`: restore mode
    * WARNING: new UMC (06a0) cards return garbage data when using 01
  * `02`: disabled
  * `03`: disabled, high speed R/W mode for Ultralight?
  * `04`: split mode, work with new UMC. With old UMC is untested.

### Direct block read and write

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

Using the backdoor command, one can read and write any area without MFC password, similarly to MFC Gen1 card. It should be noted that this command must be used to modify UID.

Backdoor read 16b block:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>CE<1b block number>
```

Backdoor write 16b block:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>CD<1b block number><16b block data>
```

Read/Write operations work on 16 bytes, no matter the Ultralight mode.

Note that only the first four bytes of each block will be mapped in the Ultralight memory map.

Example: read block0, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CE00
```

Example: write block0 with factory data, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CD00112233441C000011778185BA18000000
```

### (De)Activate direct write to block 0

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

This command enables/disables direct writes to block 0.

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>CF<1b param>
```

* `<param>`
  * `00`: Activate direct write to block 0 (Same behaviour of Gen2 cards. Some readers may identify the card as magic)
  * `01`: Deactivate direct write to block 0 (Same behaviour of vanilla cards)
  * `02`: Default value. (Same behaviour as `00` (?))

Example: enable direct writes to block 0, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CF00
```

Example: disable direct writes to block 0, default pwd

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000CF01
```

### Change backdoor password

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

All backdoor operations are protected by a password. If password is forgotten, it can't be recovered. Default password is `00000000`.

WARNING: new UMC (06A0) returns 6300 when issuing password change command. Please write the password using F0 and entering the full configuration, but with the new password.

Change password:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF <passwd> FE <4b new_password>
```

Example: change password from 00000000 to AABBCCDD

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000FEAABBCCDD
```

Example: change password from AABBCCDD back to 00000000

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CFAABBCCDDFE00000000
```

### Dump configuration

### Fast configuration

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF<passwd>F0<30b configuration data>
```

cf **Dump configuration** for configuration data description.

Example: Write factory configuration, using default password

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF00000000F000000000000002000978009102DABC191010111213141516040008004F6B
```

⚠ Variant with command `F1` instead of `F0` will set and fuse permanently the configuration. Backdoor R/W will still work.

### Version and Signature

^[Top](#top) ^^[Gen4](#g4top)

Don't forget configure maximum read/write blocks. It's can be adjusted directly in config (see *Dump configuration*) or by command 6B:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -t 1000 CF000000006BFB
```

Note: 0xFB = 251

Ultralight EV1 and NTAG Version info and Signature are stored respectively in blocks 250-251 and 242-249.
