## Identifying broken ISO14443A magic

When a magic card configuration is really messed up and the card is not labeled, it may be hard to find out which type of card it is.

Here are some tips if the card doesn't react or gives error on a simple `hf 14a reader`:

Let's force a 4b UID anticollision and see what happens:
```
hf 14a config --atqa force --bcc ignore --cl2 skip --rats skip
hf 14a reader
```
It it responds, we know it's a TypeA card. But maybe it's a 7b UID, so let's force a 7b UID anticollision:
```
hf 14a config --atqa force --bcc ignore --cl2 force --cl3 skip --rats skip
hf 14a reader
```
At this stage, you know if it's a TypeA 4b or 7b card and you can check further on this page how to reconfigure different types of cards.

To restore anticollision config of the Proxmark3:

```
hf 14a config --std
```
# MIFARE Classic

Referred as M1, S50 (1k), S70 (4k)

## MIFARE Classic block0

UID 4b: (actually NUID as there are no more "unique" IDs on 4b)

## MIFARE Classic Gen1A aka UID

### Identify

```
hf 14a info
...
[+] Magic capabilities : Gen 1a
```

### Magic commands

* Wipe: `40(7)`, `41` (use 2000ms timeout)
* Read: `40(7)`, `43`, `30xx`+crc
* Write: `40(7)`, `43`, `A0xx`+crc, `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`+crc

### Characteristics

* UID: Only 4b versions
* ATQA:
  * all cards play blindly the block0 ATQA bytes, beware!
* SAK:
  * some cards play blindly the block0 SAK byte, beware!
  * some cards use a fix "08" in anticollision, no matter the block0
  * some cards use a fix "08" in anticollision, unless SAK in block0 has most significant bit "80" set, in which case SAK="88"
* BCC:
  * all cards play blindly the block0 BCC byte, beware!
* ATS:
  * no card with ATS

#### MIFARE Classic Gen1A flavour 1

* SAK: play blindly the block0 SAK byte, beware!
* PRNG: static 01200145
* Wipe: filled with 0xFF

#### MIFARE Classic Gen1A flavour 2

* SAK: play blindly the block0 SAK byte, beware!
* PRNG: static 01200145
* Wipe: filled with 0x00

#### MIFARE Classic Gen1A flavour 3

* SAK: 08
* PRNG: static 01200145
* Wipe: filled with 0xFF

#### MIFARE Classic Gen1A flavour 4

* SAK: 08
* PRNG: weak
* Wipe: timeout, no wipe

#### MIFARE Classic Gen1A flavour 5

* SAK: 08
* PRNG: weak
* Wipe: reply ok but no wipe performed

#### MIFARE Classic Gen1A flavour 6

* SAK: 08 or 88 if block0_SAK most significant bit is set
* PRNG: weak
* Wipe: timeout, no wipe

#### MIFARE Classic Gen1A flavour 7

* SAK: 08 or 88 if block0_SAK most significant bit is set

### Proxmark3 commands

```
hf mf csetuid
hf mf cwipe
hf mf csetblk
hf mf cgetblk
hf mf cgetsc
hf mf cload 
hf mf csave
hf mf cview
```

When "soft-bricked" (by writing invalid data in block0), these ones may help:

```
# MFC Gen1A 1k:
hf mf cwipe -u 11223344 -a 0004 -s 08
# MFC Gen1A 4k:
hf mf cwipe -u 11223344 -a 0044 -s 18
```
or just fixing block0:
```
# MFC Gen1A 1k:
hf mf csetuid 11223344 0004 08
# MFC Gen1A 4k:
hf mf csetuid 11223344 0044 18
```

```
script run run hf_mf_magicrevive
```

To execute commands manually:
```
hf 14a raw -a -k -b 7       40
hf 14a raw    -k            43
hf 14a raw    -k -c         A000
hf 14a raw       -c -t 1000 11223344440804006263646566676869
```
wipe:
```
hf 14a raw -a -k -b 7       40
hf 14a raw -t 1000          41
```

### libnfc commands

```
nfc-mfsetuid
nfc-mfclassic R a u mydump
nfc-mfclassic W a u mydump
```

## MIFARE Classic Gen1B

Similar to Gen1A, but supports directly read/write after command 40

### Identify

```
hf 14a info
...
[+] Magic capabilities : Gen 1b
```

### Magic commands

* Read: `40(7)`, `30xx`
* Write: `40(7)`, `A0xx`+crc, `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`+crc

## MIFARE Classic DirectWrite aka Gen2 aka CUID

(also referred as MCT compatible by some sellers)

### Identify

```
hf 14a info
...
[+] Magic capabilities : Gen 2 / CUID
```

Not all Gen2 cards can be identified with `hf 14a info`, only those replying to RATS.

To identify the other ones, you've to try to write to block0 and see if it works...

### Magic commands

Android compatible

* issue regular write to block0

### Characteristics

* UID: 4b and 7b versions
* ATQA:
  * some cards play blindly the block0 ATQA bytes, beware!
  * some cards use a fix ATQA in anticollision, no matter the block0. Including all 7b.
* SAK:
  * some cards play blindly the block0 SAK byte, beware!
  * some cards use a fix "08" or "18" in anticollision, no matter the block0. Including all 7b.
* BCC:
  * some cards play blindly the block0 BCC byte, beware!
  * some cards compute a proper BCC in anticollision. Including all 7b computing their BCC0 and BCC1.
* ATS:
  * some cards don't reply to RATS
  * some reply with an ATS

### Proxmark3 commands

```
hf mf wrbl 0 A FFFFFFFFFFFF 11223344440804006263646566676869
```

When "soft-bricked" (by writing invalid data in block0), these ones may help:

```
hf 14a config -h
```

e.g. for 4b UID:

```
hf 14a config --atqa force --bcc ignore --cl2 skip --rats skip
hf mf wrbl 0 A FFFFFFFFFFFF 11223344440804006263646566676869 # for 1k
hf mf wrbl 0 A FFFFFFFFFFFF 11223344441802006263646566676869 # for 4k
hf 14a config --std
hf 14a reader
```

e.g. for 7b UID:

```
hf 14a config --atqa force --bcc ignore --cl2 force --cl3 skip --rats skip
hf mf wrbl 0 A FFFFFFFFFFFF 04112233445566084400626364656667 # for 1k
hf mf wrbl 0 A FFFFFFFFFFFF 04112233445566184200626364656667 # for 4k
hf 14a config --std
hf 14a reader
```
## MIFARE Classic DirectWrite, FUID version aka 1-write

Same as MIFARE Classic DirectWrite, but block0 can be written only once.

Initial UID is AA55C396

### Identify

Only possible before personalization.

```
hf 14a info
...
[+] Magic capabilities : Write Once / FUID
```

## MIFARE Classic DirectWrite, UFUID version

Same as MIFARE Classic DirectWrite, but block0 can be locked with special command.

### Identify

**TODO**

### Proxmark3 commands

To lock definitively block0:
```
hf 14a raw -a -k -b 7 40
hf 14a raw    -k      43
hf 14a raw    -k -c   e000
hf 14a raw       -c   85000000000000000000000000000008
```

## MIFARE Classic, other versions

**TODO**

* ZXUID, EUID, ICUID ?
* Some cards exhibit a specific SAK=28 ??

## MIFARE Classic APDU aka Gen3

### Identify

```
hf 14a info
...
[+] Magic capabilities : Gen 3 / APDU
```

### Magic commands

Android compatible

* issue special APDUs

```
cla  ins p1  p2  len
 90  F0  CC  CC  10 <block0>  - write block 0
 90  FB  CC  CC  07 <uid>     - change uid (independently of block0 data)
 90  FD  11  11  00           - lock permanently
```
It seems the length byte gets ignored anyway.

Note: it seems some cards only accept the "change UID" command.

It accepts direct read of block0 (and only block0) without prior auth.

Writing to block 0 has some side-effects:

* It changes also the UID. Changing the UID *does not* change block 0.
* ATQA and SAK bytes are automatically replaced by fixed values.
* On 4-byte UID cards, BCC byte is automatically corrected.

### Characteristics

* UID: 4b and 7b versions
* ATQA/SAK: fixed
* BCC: auto
* ATS: none

### Proxmark3 commands

```
# change just UID:
hf mf gen3uid
# write block0:
hf mf gen3blk
# lock (uid/block0?) forever:
hf mf gen3freeze
```
See also
```
script run hf_mf_gen3_writer -h
```

Equivalent:
```
# change just UID:
hf 14a raw -s -c  -t 2000  90FBCCCC07 11223344556677
# read block0:
hf 14a raw -s -c 3000
# write block0:
hf 14a raw -s -c  -t 2000  90F0CCCC10 041219c3219316984200e32000000000
# lock (uid/block0?) forever:
hf 14a raw -s -c 90FD111100
```

## MIFARE Classic Super

It behaves like DirectWrite but records reader auth attempts.

To change UID: same commands as for MFC DirectWrite

To do reader-only attack: at least two versions exist.

* type 1: https://github.com/nfc-tools/nfc-supercard for card with ATS: 0978009102DABC1910F005
* type 2: https://github.com/netscylla/super-card/blob/master/libnfc-1.7.1/utils/nfc-super.c for ??

### Identify

Only type 1 at the moment:

```
hf 14a info
...
[+] Magic capabilities : super card
```

# MIFARE Ultralight

## MIFARE Ultralight blocks 0..2

```
SN0  SN1  SN2  BCC0
SN3  SN4  SN5  SN6
BCC1 Int  LCK0 LCK1
```

UID is made of SN0..SN6 bytes

Computing BCC0 on UID 04112233445566: `analyse lcr 88041122` = `bf`

Computing BCC1 on UID 04112233445566: `analyse lcr 33445566` = `44`

Int is internal, typically 0x48

Anticol shortcut (CL1/3000) is supported for UL, ULC, NTAG except NTAG I2C


## MIFARE Ultralight Gen1A

### Identify

**TODO**

### Characteristics

#### Magic commands

**TODO**

#### UID

Only 7b versions

#### SAK, ATQA, BCC, ATS

**TODO** need more tests

### Proxmark3 commands

```
script run hf_mfu_setuid -h
```

When "soft-bricked" (by writing invalid data in block0), these ones may help:

```
hf 14a config -h
script run run hf_mf_magicrevive -u
```

## MIFARE Ultralight DirectWrite

### Identify

```
hf 14a info
...
[+] Magic capabilities : Gen 2 / CUID
```

It seems so far that all MFUL DW have an ATS.

### Magic commands

Issue three regular MFU write commands in a row to write first three blocks.

### Characteristics

* UID: Only 7b versions
* ATQA:
  * all cards play fix ATQA
* SAK:
  * all cards play fix SAK
* BCC:
  * some cards play blindly the block0 BCC0 and block2 BCC1 bytes, beware!
  * some cards compute proper BCC0 and BCC1 in anticollision
* ATS:
  * all cards reply with an ATS

#### MIFARE Ultralight DirectWrite flavour 1

* BCC: computed
* ATS: 0A78008102DBA0C119402AB5
* Anticol shortcut (CL1/3000): fails

#### MIFARE Ultralight DirectWrite flavour 2

* BCC: play blindly the block0 BCC0 and block2 BCC1 bytes, beware!
* ATS: 850000A00A000AB00000000000000000184D
* Anticol shortcut (CL1/3000): succeeds

### Proxmark3 commands

```
hf mfu setuid
```

Equivalent: don't use `hf mfu wrbl` as you need to write three blocks in a row, but do, with proper BCCx:

```
hf 14a raw -s -c -k a2 00 041122bf 
hf 14a raw    -c -k a2 01 33445566
hf 14a raw    -c    a2 02 44480000
```

When "soft-bricked" (by writing invalid data in block0), these ones may help:

```
hf 14a config -h
```

E.g.:
```
hf 14a config --atqa force --bcc ignore --cl2 force --cl3 skip --rats skip
hf mfu setuid 04112233445566
hf 14a config --std
hf 14a reader
```

# DESFire

## "DESFire" APDU, 7b UID

### Identify

**TODO**

### Magic commands

Android compatible

* issue special APDUs

### Characteristics

* ATQA: 0344
* SAK: 20
* ATS: 0675338102005110 or 06757781028002F0

Only mimics DESFire anticollision (but wrong ATS), no further DESFire support

### Proxmark commands

UID 04112233445566
```
hf 14a raw -s -c 0200ab00000704112233445566
```
or equivalently

## "DESFire" APDU, 4b UID

### Magic commands

Android compatible

* issue special APDUs

### Characteristics

* ATQA: 0008 ??? This is not DESFire, 0008/20 doesn't match anything
* SAK: 20
* ATS: 0675338102005110 or 06757781028002F0
