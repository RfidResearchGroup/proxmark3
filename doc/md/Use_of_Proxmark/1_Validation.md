## 1. Validating proxmark client functionality

If all went well you should get some information about the firmware and memory usage as well as the prompt,  something like this.

[usb] pm3 --> 
```

This `[usb] pm3 --> ` is the Proxmark3 interactive prompt.


### To get interactive help

For basic help type `help`. Or for help on a set of sub commands type the command followed by `help`. For example `hf mf help`.

### First tests

These commands will return some info about your Proxmark software and hardware status.
```
[usb] pm3 --> hw status
[usb] pm3 --> hw version
[usb] pm3 --> hw tune
```

You are now ready to use your newly flashed proxmark3 device.  Many commands uses the `h` parameter to show a help text.

### To quit the client
```
[usb] pm3 --> quit
```
or simple press `CTRL-D`.

## Next steps

Some configuration steps are still needed.
