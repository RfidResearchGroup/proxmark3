# Homebrew (Mac OS X), automatic installation

## Apple Silicon (M1) Notes

Ensure Rosetta 2 is installed as it's currently needed to run `arm-none-eabi-gcc` as it's delivered as a precombiled x86_64 binary.

If you see an error like:

```sh
bad CPU type in executable
```

Then you are missing Rosetta 2 and need to install it: `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta`

Homebrew has changed their prefix to differentiate between native Apple Silicon and Intel compiled binaries.  The Makefile attempts to account for this but please note that whichever terminal or application you're using must be running under Architecture "Apple" as seen by Activity Monitor as all child processes inherit the Rosetta 2 environment of their parent.  You can check which architecture you're currently running under with a `uname -m` in your terminal.

Visual Studio Code still runs under Rosetta 2 and if you're developing for proxmark3 on an Apple Silicon Mac you might want to consider running the Insiders build which has support for running natively on Apple Silicon.

## Install Proxmark3 tools

These instructions comes from @Chrisfu, where we got the proxmark3.rb scriptfile from.
For further questions about Mac & Homebrew,  contact @Chrisfu  (https://github.com/chrisfu/)

1. Install homebrew if you haven't yet already done so: http://brew.sh/

2. Tap this repo: `brew tap RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3`

3. Install Proxmark3:
  - (Optional) `export HOMEBREW_PROXMARK3_PLATFORM=xxxxxx` to specify [platform](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/blob/master/doc/md/Use_of_Proxmark/4_Advanced-compilation-parameters.md#platform), default value is `PM3RDV4` if none
  - `brew install proxmark3` for stable release 
  - `brew install --HEAD proxmark3` for latest non-stable from GitHub (use this if previous command fails)
  - `brew install --with-blueshark proxmark3` for blueshark support, stable release
  - `brew install --HEAD --with-blueshark proxmark3` for blueshark support, latest non-stable from GitHub (use this if previous command fails)

## Upgrade HomeBrew tap formula

*This method is useful for those looking to run bleeding-edge versions of RRG/iceman's client. Keep this in mind when attempting to update your HomeBrew tap formula as this procedure could easily cause a build to break if an update is unstable on macOS.* 

Tested on macOS Mojave 10.14.4

*Note: This assumes you have already installed RRG/iceman's fork from HomeBrew as mentioned above*

Force HomeBrew to pull the latest source from github

```sh
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD proxmark3
```

## Flash the BOOTROM & FULLIMAGE

With your Proxmark3 unplugged from your machine, press and hold the button on your Proxmark3 as you plug it into a USB port. You can release the button, two of the four LEDs should stay on. You're in bootloader mode, ready for the next step. In case the two LEDs don't stay on when you're releasing the button, you've an old bootloader, start over and keep the button pressed during the whole flashing procedure.

In principle, the helper script `pm3-flash-all` should auto-detect your port, so you can just try:

```sh
pm3-flash-all
```

If port detection failed, you'll have to call the flasher manually and specify the correct port:

```sh
proxmark3 /dev/tty.usbmodemiceman1 --flash --unlock-bootloader --image /usr/local/share/proxmark3/firmware/bootrom.elf --image /usr/local/share/proxmark3/firmware/fullimage.elf
```

> Depending on the firmware version your Proxmark3 can also appear as `/dev/tty.usbmodem881`.


## Run the client

```sh
pm3
```

or, if the port doesn't get properly detected:

```sh
proxmark3 /dev/tty.usbmodemiceman1
```

# Homebrew (Mac OS X), developer installation

These instructions will show how to setup the environment on OSX to the point where you'll be able to clone and compile the repo by yourself, as on Linux, Windows, etc.

1. Install homebrew if you haven't yet already done so: http://brew.sh/

2. Install dependencies:

```
brew install readline qt5 pkgconfig
brew install RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/arm-none-eabi-gcc
```
3. (optional) Install makefile dependencies:
```
brew install recode
brew install astyle
```


## Compile and use the project

To use the compiled client, the only difference is that the Proxmark3 port is `/dev/tty.usbmodemiceman1`, so commands become:

```sh
proxmark3 /dev/ttyACM0  =>  proxmark3 /dev/tty.usbmodemiceman1
```

Now you're ready to follow the [compilation instructions](/doc/md/Use_of_Proxmark/0_Compilation-Instructions.md).

To flash on OS X, better to enter the bootloader mode manually, else you may experience errors.
With your Proxmark3 unplugged from your machine, press and hold the button on your Proxmark3 as you plug it into a USB port. You can release the button, two of the four LEDs should stay on. You're in bootloader mode, ready for the next step. In case the two LEDs don't stay on when you're releasing the button, you've an old bootloader, start over and keep the button pressed during the whole flashing procedure.
From there, you can follow the original compilation instructions.
