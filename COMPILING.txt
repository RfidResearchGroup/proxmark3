The project compiles on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows (MinGW/MSYS).

it requires:
- gcc >= 4.4
- libpthread
- libreadline
- libusb
- perl
- an ARM cross-compiler to compile the firmware

and optionally QT for the GUI


To compile, just run "make".

===========
= Windows =
===========
The following is a complete list of packages required to setup the compile environment yourself. Alternatively you can download an archive of the full environment (see below).

1 - Install QT SDK for Windows [1]

In the following instructions, we'll assume you installed it to C:\QT

2 - MSYS-1.0.11 [2]

Just follow the installation procedure.
When asked if you have MinGW installed and for its path, provide:
C:/QT/mingw

3 - readline-5.0-1-bin [5]

From this archive, copy:
bin/* to C:\QT\mingw\bin
include/* to C:\QT\mingw\include
lib/*.a to C:\QT\mingw\lib

4 - libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2 [6]

Be careful here, it is *NOT* working with the filter version!
Likewise copy:
include/usb.h to C:\QT\mingw\include
lib/gcc/libusb.a to C:\QT\mingw\lib


5 - Install DevkitPro [5]

You'll need it to compile the firmware (ARM) side.
You only need devkitARM, nothing more (no extra lib or anything else)
Assuming you installed it to C:\devkitpro, make sure you set
the DEVKITARM environment variable to /c/devkitPro/devkitARM :
export DEVKITARM=/c/devkitPro/devkitARM
Also, add its bin to your PATH:
export PATH=$PATH:$DEVKITARM/bin

6 - Install Strawberry Perl [6]

7 - Setup a few variables

In your shell from MSYS, make sure you set QTDIR to your QT installation:
export QTDIR=/c/QT/qt
And add its bin to your path as well:
export PATH=$PATH:$QTDIR/bin

Rather than download and install every one of these packages, a new ProxSpace
environment archive file will be made available for download on the project
page at http://code.google.com/p/proxmark3/downloads/list

Download the ProxSpace environment archive and extract it to C:\

= Mac OS X =
============

Tested on OSX 10.10 Yosemite

1 - Install Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools

2 - Install Homebrew and dependencies
    brew install readline
    brew instal libusb

3 - Download DevKitARM for OSX
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/devkitARM_r44/
    Unpack devkitARM_r44-osx.tar.bz2 to proxmark3 directory.

4 - Edit proxmark3/client/Makefile adding path to readline

    LDLIBS = -L/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/lib/ -L/opt/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib ../liblua/liblua.a -lreadline -lpthread -lm
    CFLAGS = -std=c99 -I/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/include/ -I. -I../include -I../common -I/opt/local/include -I../liblua  -Wall $(COMMON_FLAGS) -g -O4

    Replace path /usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8 with your actuall readline path. See homebrew manuals.

5 - Set Environment

    export DEVKITPRO=$HOME/proxmark3/
    export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM
    export PATH=${PATH}:${DEVKITARM}/bin


============
=   Linux  =
============

1 - Download 

A precompiled DevKitARM cross compiler tool chain package can be found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM
Select the one you need (32bit or 64bit) and unpack to a convinient place, eg 
$HOME/proxmark3/. It will create a devkitARM/ subdirectory.

You will also need a general compiling environment on your computer for
the client and the libusb headers. In most distributions you will get all you 
need with the lsb-package (Linux Standard Base). In debian/ubuntu you simply 
call `aptitude install lsb libusb-dev libreadline-dev libreadline6`. 

For the graphical plot view, you might need the qtlibs (debian/ubuntu: 
libqt4-dev), too.

2 - Set Environment

export DEVKITPRO=$HOME/proxmark3/
export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM
export PATH=${PATH}:${DEVKITARM}/bin
