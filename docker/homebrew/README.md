# Notes on linux homebrew

Do not `brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc`, it's a Mach-O executable.

So only host bins can be built (except tools/hitag2crack/crack5opencl which needs OpenCL)

## Makefile

```sh
make -j client USE_BREW=1 SKIPREADLINE=1
make -j mfkey
make -j nonce2key
make -j mf_nonce_brute
make -j hitag2crack SKIPOPENCL=1
make -j fpga_compress
```

## CMake

```sh
cd client
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DEMBED_BZIP2=1 ..
make -j
```
