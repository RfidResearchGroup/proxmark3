HOW TO COMPILE IN 2023

Much has changed in the many years since this was released, Spartan 2 family of devices is obsolete and no longer supported by recent tools.
Xilinx has been bought by AMD...
This is a general overview of what works currently in Windows 10/11:
	* Download ISE 10.1 (later versions do NOT support Spartan 2)
	* The download is 6GB in size and to reach the download page you need to register and login with an account!
	* Download location is https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/archive-ise.html
	* Install ISE 10.1 to C:\Xilinx\10.1\ISE_DS\
	* During install you need to provide Registration Code 11LTAJ5ZJK3PXTUBMF0C0J6C4

Alternative 1 (prefered for development)
	* Install the latest Proxspace from https://github.com/Gator96100/ProxSpace
	* Enter Prosxpace command line
	* Set your path with "export PATH=$PATH:/C/Xilinx/10.1/ISE_DS/ISE/bin/nt64" or some other more permanent way
	* Change directory into the source directory of proxmak3/fpga-xc2s30
	* make all
	* make clean

Alternative 2
	* In directory proxmak3/fpga-xc2s30 open the file make.bat with a text editor
	* Check and if neccessary update the line "SET PATH=C:\Xilinx\10.1\ISE_DS\ISE\bin\nt64;C:\Xilinx\10.1\ISE_DS\ISE\lib\nt64;%PATH%"
	* Run make.bat

If no errors come up there should be four files created "fpga_felica.bit", "fpga_hf.bit", "fpga_hf_15.bit" and "fpga_lf.bit"

IMPORTANT NOTE

If you chose to run the ISE 10.1 GUI on WIndows 10 or 11 the program will crash as soon as you try to open a file.
The generally accepted workaround for that problem is this:
	* Use the Windows System Properties to edit the "Environment Variables"
	* Change the SYSTEM PATH and edit "%XILINX%\bin\nt64;%XILINX%\lib\nt64;" to "%XILINX%\bin\nt;%XILINX%\lib\nt;"
	* Edit the shortcut properties for the ISE shortcut on your desktop and change "C:\Xilinx\10.1\ISE_DS\ISE\bin\nt64\ise.exe" to "C:\Xilinx\10.1\ISE_DS\ISE\bin\nt\ise.exe"
	* After this you can run the shortcut and use the ISE Design Suite 10.1 as expected.
